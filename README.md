# Installation
First, **make sure** you have git-lfs installed!
```
git lfs install
```
Next, clone the repository
```
git clone https://github.com/shanealv/testoverhead2DShooter.git
```
To open in Unity, open unity and select **OPEN** and navigate to root folder of the project.  Unity will detect that it is indeed a Unity project.  You may then select that folder to open the project.

**NOTE**: Unity must be [configured](https://bertt.wordpress.com/2017/02/08/using-net-standard-libraries-in-unity3d/) to use .Net 4.6 to enable C# 6 support
